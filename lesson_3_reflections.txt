When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if you're collaborating with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
you may not be ready to pull in code from others yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches happen within a single repository 
Clones take an existing repository and copy it to another (can happen locally or from github to local). When you clone a repo, it automatically sets up a remote for you 
Fork - copying a repository to another on github

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you can work offline, and you understand what changes have been made so far on the collaborative project so you can plan for those in your work

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
you would have to figure out how to sync up any changes to the same body of work, which could be done through modularizing your work, but would be tougher. it may be easier to use a platform with automatic syncing so you don't have to manually do things but all previous work is lost, making it tougher to experiment

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
any time you collaborate, you should make changes in a separate branch so your collaborators have a chance to review the work before putting it in master. this allows you to catch any bugs or issues before adding them to your master branch
