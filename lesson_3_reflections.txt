When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if you're collaborating with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
you may not be ready to pull in code from others yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches happen within a single repository 
Clones take an existing repository and copy it to another (can happen locally or from github to local). When you clone a repo, it automatically sets up a remote for you 
Fork - copying a repository to another on github
