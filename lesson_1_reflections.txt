Reflection 1: 
How did viewing a difference between two versions help you spot the bug? 
it's quicker to see the differences and know exactly what changed, 
easy to see even minor changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you can see what you've changed and go back to an old version 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create 
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
con: users might forget or not commit often enough
pro: commits make more logical sense and help organize work 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
so that you can keep track of files that are related together 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log displays all the different commits for a file 
git diff shows the differences between two commits 
git log --stat shows stats on how many lines were changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make 
changes that could break something?
you can always revert back to a previous version and debug easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
check which kind of files you can compare
